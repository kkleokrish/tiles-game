Tiles is a simple two player boardgame. The board is 7x7. Each player is assigned a colored tile (or such, based on the front end implementation). The goal of the game is to place 4 of your tiles contiguously in horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The player first reaching the goal is considered the winner.

The core engine is in Tiles.js and any frontend can be build on top of that. Sample front end HTMLs one two player with option to play with computer and another between two computer players.
